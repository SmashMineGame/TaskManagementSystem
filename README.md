## Task Management System

### Capabilities
* Make it easy for users to create and edit tasks
* Allow users to add more advanced task information such as:
	* start and end date
	* time it takes to complete the task
	* Duration of work period
	* Hard and Soft Deadlines
	* Time willing to spend on task each day
* Allow multiple ways to visualize tasks including: List, Calendar, etc.

Using the "advanced" task information, you can not only see what tasks you have, but also schedule when you will complete them. By spreading work across multiple days, productivity is increased and it is much harder to procastinate.
